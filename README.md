# STORIX
# LSTM Stock Price Prediction
 This is a Python code for stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The code uses the 'MinMaxScaler' from the 'sklearn.preprocessing'  module to scale the input data, and 'Sequential' model from the 'keras.models' module to build the LSTM model.

## Dependencies
 *  Python 3.x
 *  'numpy' library
 * 'pandas' library
 *  'sklearn' library
 *  'keras' library
   
# Dataset
 The dataset used for this code is assumed to be stored in the training_set variable. The dataset should be in the form of a numpy array or pandas dataframe, with the stock price values in a single column.

# Data Preprocessing
 The MinMaxScaler is used to scale the training dataset between 0 and 1. This is done to normalize the data and prevent large values from dominating the neural network training process. The scaled dataset is split into training and testing data using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection module.
 
# Model Architecture
 The LSTM model consists of two LSTM layers with 50 units each, followed by two fully connected (Dense) layers. The first LSTM layer takes input sequences of length 50, while the second LSTM layer does not return sequences, meaning it outputs a single vector as output. The activation function used in the LSTM layers is the default tanh activation. The output from the last dense layer is a single predicted value, representing the stock price prediction.
 
# Model Training
The model is compiled with the mean squared error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer. The training is performed using the fit function with a batch size of 60 and 100 epochs. The training data is used for training the model, and the validation data is used for evaluating the model performance during training.

# Prediction
The trained model is used to make predictions on both the training and testing data. The predicted values are stored in the train_predict and test_predict variables, respectively.

# Note
Please note that stock price prediction is a complex task and the accuracy of the predictions may vary depending on various factors such as the quality of the dataset, model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and external factors affecting stock prices. This code serves as a basic example and can be further optimized for specific use cases.


# Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Place your own time series data in CSV format in the data.csv file. Make sure the data is properly formatted with the appropriate column names.
4. Run the main.py script using a Python interpreter or an IDE that supports Python.
5. The script will preprocess the data by applying MinMax scaling and splitting it into training and testing sets.
6. The LSTM model will be trained on the training data using the specified architecture and hyperparameters.
7. After training, the model will generate predictions for the training and testing data.
8. The predicted values will be plotted against the actual values using Matplotlib to visualize the performance of the model.
9. You can experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, and data preprocessing techniques to optimize the performance of the LSTM model for your        specific time series data.
