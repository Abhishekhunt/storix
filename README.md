LSTM Time Series Prediction
This repository contains code for time series prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The code is implemented using Python and Keras, a popular deep learning library.

Overview
The code in this repository includes the following files:

main.py: This is the main script that contains the LSTM model for time series prediction. It includes importing necessary libraries such as matplotlib, math, sklearn, and keras, as well as defining the LSTM model architecture, compiling the model, and fitting it to the data.
data.csv: This is the input data file in CSV format that contains the time series data for training the LSTM model.
README.md: This is the readme file that provides instructions and information about the code.
Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the code in this repository:

Matplotlib
Math
Scikit-learn
Keras
You can install these libraries using the following commands:

Copy code
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install keras
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.
Place your own time series data in CSV format in the data.csv file. Make sure the data is properly formatted with the appropriate column names.
Run the main.py script using a Python interpreter or an IDE that supports Python.
The script will preprocess the data by applying MinMax scaling and splitting it into training and testing sets.
The LSTM model will be trained on the training data using the specified architecture and hyperparameters.
After training, the model will generate predictions for the training and testing data.
The predicted values will be plotted against the actual values using Matplotlib to visualize the performance of the model.
You can experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, and data preprocessing techniques to optimize the performance of the LSTM model for your specific time series data.
Results
The trained LSTM model will generate predicted values for the training and testing data. These predicted values can be compared with the actual values to evaluate the performance of the model. The performance can be assessed using various evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. The model can be further fine-tuned by adjusting hyperparameters, model architecture, or data preprocessing techniques to achieve better results.
